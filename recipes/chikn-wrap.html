    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Back in college, I worked at a food court on campus that made wraps, similar to Subway for sandwiches. I ended up just buying a lot of the ingreients to make these wraps at home, and they've become a staple of my diet. Here is a vegetarian variant of the most popular wrap we served, the Chicken Cheddar Wrap. I've swapped it's lettuce for spinach and the cheddar cheese for colby jack.</p>
