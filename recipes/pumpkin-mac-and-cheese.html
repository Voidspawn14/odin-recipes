    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a medium pot halfway with water, cover, and bring to a boil. Uncover, add pasta and salt, and stir for a few seconds. Cook until desired firmness, 8-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>While pasta is cooking, melt butter (1 tbsp) in another medium pot over medium-high heat. Stir, cooking until butter has browned, 3-4 minutes. Watch it carefully so that it does not burn.</li>
        <li>Remove pot from heat, stir in flour (1 tbsp), whisking constantly, 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Return pot to heat, gradually stir in milk. Bring to a simmer and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly, until thickened.</li>
        <li>Wash and dry thyme. Slide leaves off the stems; discard the stems.</li>
        <li>Stir in pumpkin, salt, pepper, and most of the thyme (reserve some for garnish). </li>
        <li>Grate cheese and add to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>When macaroni is done cooking, drain in a colander. Add to the cheese sauce and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>To serve, divide the macaroni and cheese between plates or bowls and sprinkle with fresh thyme. Enjoy!</li>
