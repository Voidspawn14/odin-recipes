    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A delicious spin on the tried-and-true recipe of Mac & Cheese for fall. This recipe adds a helping of pumpkin puree to the mix to create something autumnal and filling.</p>
    <p>If you've made homemade mac & cheese before, this recipe shouldn't be too surprising other than the addition of pumpkin puree, which can be purchased conviently premade in a can at most grocery stores.</p>
